Report on in-progress items
---------------------------

:ref:`sar-scenarios`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Chris and Tridge talked with the SES last Tuesday in regards to the specifics of search and rescue
 * They are very interested at having us participate in one of their exercises (even just as a proof-of-concept)
 * Procedures and manuals are very important for the SES
 * They may be able to assist us in cutting through CASA's red tape
 * All of this will need to be confirmed and supported by the senior SES officers, which we are yet to talk to
 * We are going to have to start building up 1 or 2 X8's with the full search and rescue package (cameras and onboard computer, etc) for this

:ref:`dgps`
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Hardware is up and running
 * Got good quality results for about an hour, then poor quality results
 * Still investigating the issue

:ref:`mu-thermal-camera`

 * It has been fully funded on IndieGogo. We should expect one of their cameras in the coming months

:ref:`schools-program`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Lost a Boomerang aircraft due to the infamous wing-folding issue
 * There's 4-5 students learning RC flight at BMAC
 
Other Business
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * CMAC was broken into over the weekend with several parts of the CMAC weather station being stolen or damaged (Rasberry Pi, camera). We are going to have to think of better ways to secure or hide the equipment.
 * Stephen has a brief conversation with the Mountain Bike Race people, who want CanberraUAV to possibly provide some aerial photography of their event. We will be with them on the 13th April to figure out what we can realistically provide.
