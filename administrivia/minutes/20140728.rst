Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Last weekend's testing did not go well - we found a (fatal) bug in our Pixhawk setup that required the entire weekend to to find a work-around.
 * Deliverable 3 is coming along well. It is due 1.5 weeks from now. Just need to add the final touches to the flight logs.
 * Emphasis is getting the full ground station working for next weekend's testing.
 * Need to do as many bottle drops as possible from now until the OBC - in order to test it's reliability.
 * Decided to buy a ~40" TV for the ground station. Budget is ~$600.
 * Will use a trailer to transport the assembled Bushmaster during the OBC. Chris has a trailer which we will test for sizing next weekend.
 *Went though the todo list and assigned tasks. Will revisit this on a weekly basis.
