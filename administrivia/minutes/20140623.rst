Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Bushmaster V1.1 (re)build is again almost done. All that needs to be done is to fit the power system, servos and avionics.
 * Maiden flight will likely be this coming weekend, subject to weather and CMAC certification.
 * 5 weekends to D3. Thus we should be averaging at least 2 hours autonomous flight each weekend.
 * In reality, get as many flight hours as possible. The weather is not nice this time of year.
 * Chris has the GCS build underway. Should be able to demo it in 2 weeks.

Other business
--------------

 * Team shirts have been ordered. They should be a bit over $40 each.
 * SF-02 Laser range finders were testing over the weekend. Results are very positive and should make auto-landing much safer.
