Tridge to borrow Darrel Bixler 2 and test new code.

Stephen Dade flying OS Tuesday night

Outback Challenge
=================
Rumour it will be released this week

Try to get interest for new members into Canberra UAV - submit 2 teams if get enough new joiners?  Check what new rules state in this regard.  Figure out job roles for new starters.


Weather Station Update
======================
Nearly all protocol decoded.  
WXForum - Davis Barometer is in base station - not remote station.  So no barometer readings moving forward.
Still figuring out camera - either fix one Tridge gave Chris or buy new one.

CMAC vandalised roughly every 6 months

CSIRO Collaboration
===================
Waiting on CSIRO to get back to CanberraUAV.

Search and Rescue Scenarios from SES
====================================
Chris to chase ACT Emergency Services 
Flesh out documents and then adapt them for UAV usage - everyone to provide feedback through the mailing list
Scenario feedback from community to determine what scenario's need to be targeted

General
=======
PX4 - wider range of options - BUS and DSM ports on board.  Talk to Specturm receiver.
Tridge - Satellite receiver bound to PX4
Can't wire it up for twin receiver - small plane then Spectrum satellite ok. Our UAVs better going with FrSky.
FrSky new transmitter - Taranis - looks good?


Catapult
========
DIY Drones Jack - looks a bit light on to launch an X8
Prefer a ramp to stop scraping over the first few feet
