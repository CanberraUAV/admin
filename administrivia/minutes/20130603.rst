Other business
--------------

Open Relief airframe offered for our evaluation:

 * Proposal to ship to Australia after flight testing in UK
 * potentially interesting, but have some reservations about performance claims

Jack and Chris have been discussing a new Airframe design
 * 2.4m span, 6 or 7 AR, clark Y (or similar, ~14%).
 * based around a 50cc two cylinder motor
 * optimised for simplest 
 * STOL style; big wheels big flaps. Suitable for improvised runways (dirt roads)
 * faster than Telemaster but not as quick as the Muggin

ETS airspeed sensor
 * will test soon in QueenBee
 * also need to set up a current sensor, may use the airspeed port because it has a built in voltage divider
 * This avoids over voltage risk on 3.3v ADC
