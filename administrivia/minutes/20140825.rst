Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * All-up testing went very well over the weekend. Setup was done in the 15min time limit, despite it being our first time.
 * Long range datalink tests from Red Hill were less successful, partiucalr on the 900MHz link. This was later attributed to a broken contact on the radio module on the Porter.
 * Agreed to buy 2x extra RFD900's and associated accessories
 * The inverter in the van can't power the TV, radios and 3x laptops. The solution is to run the laptops on battery power.
 * Jack will bring a backup generator just in case.
 * Many bottle drops done. Generally all good, though 1 drop was >50m off. Not sure if this is just an outlier. More testing is required in varying wind conditions.
 * Bushmaster should be ready for flight in 1.5 weeks if all goes according to plan.
 * 2nd Porter build is coming along, but needs much more work.
 * Plan for the upcoming weekend will be more long-range data tests and auto-takeoffs
 * Will do another all-up test on the 6th September.
