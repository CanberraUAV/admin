2013 March 04
=============

Documentation
-------------
 * Decided to persist with the new system for the time being at least.
 * About half of the initial data is in here now. The rest should be in by the end of next weekend
 * This will diminish our reliance on the (vast) mailing list archives and file sharing sites (Google Docs)


Insurance
---------
 * Expired yesterday (2012/04/03)
 * Currently only able to fly at CMAC under MAAA-SGA rules
 * Need to contact organisers WRT insurance associated with the competition
 * Hope it doesn't take as long as last time

Notes from Avalon
-----------------
 * OBC competition is having difficulty with their own insurance
 * Possibly related to actuarial costs (small cheese)
 * What do the licensed commercial UAV companies do? GA-type insurance policy?
 * The rules of the 2014 Challenge should be out in the next couple of weeks
 * One the rules do come out, we should hold a public meeting to encourage and organise new members to join in
 * If we're lucky we might have enough team members to enter 2 (separate) teams into the challenge

DGPS development
----------------
 * Good progress on the software side
 * Hardware issues - NAK TRCMv2 ? One blocker, may be minor.

Purchases
---------
 * New telemaster
 * Electronics purchases = PX4, GPS, associated wiring and power systems. Will need enough to fit out a couple of aircraft.
