Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Deliverable 2 - We now have all the raw video. Stephen will work on editing them into a final video to be put on Youtube.
 * Deliverable 2 - Stephen will start drafting up the report this week. Will review as a group next week and have a final version by the 16th.
 * The Busmaster's fuselage is done. Wings are a work-in-progress. It will then take a few weeks for fitout of the avionics.
 * The Porter (now that we've got the D2 video from it) will be used for the more riskier tests over the next couple of weeks - auto takeoff/landing and experimenting with different propellors.
