Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Last weekend's testing was quite successful - we tested the imagery, 5.8GHz link and mockup of the ground station
 * From this, there are a few things that need to be fixed: Camera USB cable, geolocation algorithm, some tweaks to the image processing, landing gear strenthened.
 * It would be useful to have a card reader for the eMMC card on the Odroid for dumping imagery between flights.
 * Important to get the bottle drop working ASAP - only 6 Bushmaster weekends to go.
 * Also need to fit the RFD900 and SFO_02 (radio and laser finder respectively).
