Report on in-progress items
---------------------------

New testing ground (Geoff's place)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Excellent site for long range testing, regular use acceptable, access to a workshop and cake is provided.

 * Did a sucessful test flight yestersday with the full system
 * GPS issues, compass turned off (magnetic interference) in the new plane
 * camera calibration problems (roll). We need a good procedure.
 * image quality OK with the ODroid rig
 * ODroid had no issues with CV code

Search area flown on the weekend was 850m * 240m (visual range because relatively imature plane), larger area possible within property boundary.
