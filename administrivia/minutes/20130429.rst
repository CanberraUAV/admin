Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC 2014
^^^^^^^^
 * New Rules out.  See email to list for differences.
 * Airframe goals previously set (maybe need to or able to compromise now)

   * Easily portable
   * Launch from clearing
   * fly 100km for 1 hour
   * Carry 1kg of payload plus bottle

 * Two cameras in parallel or one wider angle higher res camera and fly at 120m instead of 90m. 
 * Faster CPUs (new ODroid) 6x processing power from last time
 * Fly slower thus conserve fuel therefore fly longer
 * MMC bus could be used
 * Previous Bottle neck reading images from camera and saving for later
 * Run USB Bus and SD card in parallel.  Maybe get very large fast SD cards and free up bus bandwidth for Cameras
 * SDCard random write performance awful but for photos (large continuous blocks) fine
 * Separate computer per camera?
 * Ethernet camera?  Ethernet is USB bus on ODroid so perhaps no gain - TODO, Tridge will investigate
 * 400ft is the ceiling if the model is likely to go out of sight
 * 1st Deliverable is due no later 5pm 7 August.
 * Moving our image recognition algorithms to run on the GPU of the ODroid - PHD Students investigating with loaned ODroid
 * Summary - can we use better cameras and image recognition to fly slower and hence possibly different airframe


SAR Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * See link posted by Chris - http://canberrauav.readthedocs.org/en/latest/in-progres/SAR-scenarios.html
