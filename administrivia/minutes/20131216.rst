Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Bottle drop - Testing from the weekend was good.  Drogue chute testing was good with new release mechanism.
 * Failsafe mechanism needs to be "re-discovered".  

      * Failsafe board doesn't know what mode your in so doesn't know whether loss of RC control is bad thing or not.  That decision needs to be made by component of aircraft which knows what mode it is in because correct action depends on mode.  Therefore decision must be in APM.  APM knows mode, it knows if in manual mode and you loose RC stop sending heartbeat to failsafe board and raise failsafe pin to failsafe board.  This effectively instructs the failsafe board to enter failsafe.  Its de-bounced by the APM - the OBC module in the APM.

 * Priorities for January - More bottle drop testing, fail safe functioning, Beaver build and flying.  Radio range testing.
 * Website - being worked on over Christmas
