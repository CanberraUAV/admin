Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Weekend testing went well - plenty of bottle drops, joe-detection and auto takeoff/landing. It was cut short by a couple of snapped propellor bolts however.
 * More bottles will be built this week, assuming the parachutes are delivered in time.
 * In order to give ourselves more time at Kingaroy, we will be leaving on the Friday (19th) so we have all Sunday at Kingaroy to unpack and test equipment.
 * We will be doing another all-up test on the 6th.
 * We need to practice quickly refitting he bottle after a flight if we intend to do multiple drops at the OBC.


Antenna Tracker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

 * Needs a bit more testing.
 

Other business
