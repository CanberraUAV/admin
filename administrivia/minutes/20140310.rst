---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Pilatus Porter flights over the weekend went well. Some damage to the landing gear on a heavy landing. Will need to reinforce the struts.
 * Tailwheel steering is still a bit iffy. Need a stronger horn/control rods to be effective.
 * Muffler fell off during flight. Will buy a replacement.
 * RF interference issue solved by moving components around and replacing (broken) grouns station 933 MHz radio.
 * D2 video of bottle drop was successful.
 * Will video takeoff and landing next weekend.
