Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Last weekend's testing: Odroid causes interference into GPS module. Will need to (re)mount there modules far away from each other to reduce the interference to a suitable minimum.
 * Now up to 5 hours AUTO flight!
 * D3 video is coming along nicely. We do need some more shots of the full ground station. We will do this next weekend.
 * We have 10 weekends left until the OBC. This will likely go down to 7-8 weeks accounting for bad weather. Stephen will map a plan for this time.
