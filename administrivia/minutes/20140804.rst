Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Last weekend's testing went very well. Did a full GCS test with imaging and bottle drop - was a success!
 * Autotakeoff was also successfully tested.
 * The GCS is almost complete - power system and radio masts all work. Still needs some work with shading though.
 * The Bushmaster suffered a small crash during a landing approach, due to a stall a few metres above the ground. The damage is definitely fixable and the Bushmaster should be up and running next weekend.
 * Will have a build night at Jack's place this week.
 * Grant is build up a spares list and will circulate it soon.
 * More bottle drops this coming weekend.
