Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * The Beaver crashed shortly after takeoff last weekend.
 * Given the amount of time and effort taken to repair the Beaver, it would be easier at this point to switch to an airframe with better handling.
 * A fitted-out Pilatus Porter will cost around $1500.
 * Grant will organise the purchasing of this.
 * Also required are the flight electronics. We will buy 2x Pixhawks and USB panels from 3DR. Grant will also organise this.
 * In terms of construction, Grant and Andrew will focus on the Porter whilst Jack and Chris will continue with the Bushmaster.
 * This way we should expect 2 completed airframes in the next couple of weeks.
 * The Porter will also require a 5.8 GHz Rocket radio and a RFD900 Radio. Will organise the purchasing at a later date.
