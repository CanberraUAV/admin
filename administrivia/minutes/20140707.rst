 * Bushmaster test flights over the weekend were very successful. The aircraft handles very well after the repairs
 * We achieved 2 hours of AUTO flight.
 * Plan for next weekend is to fit the camera, Odroid and 5.8 GHz antenna so we can test the imaging capture and processing.
 * Will fit the bottle drop mechanism after that.
