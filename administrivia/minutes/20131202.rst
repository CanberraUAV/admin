Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Bottle drop - 

    * First drop was text book and the Helibox performed extremely well.  Very slow fall rate.
    * Second drop it fell like a stone as aerofoils did not deploy
    * Third drop performed ok but quite a bit of pendulum
    * Questions - which way do we strap the Helibox to the plan.  "Head" first so the aerofoils aren't ripped open by wind speed on release.
    * Need to have a positive deployment of the aerofoils
    * Need to weather proof design
    * Perhaps the aerofoils don't need to be so sophisticated and we could have flat plastic panels instead.
    * Prototype v1 works great - now v2 testing alternate ideas is needed 

 * Website and mailing list transfer to Tridge's servers.  All complete.
 * Do we want Drupal, Wordpress or Joomla - looks like Wordpress might be easiest.
 * Beaver still under repair - lets hope we don't crash it.  In future, we should get anything that's not a beaver, ground loops are a problem, needs longer fuse, bigger rudder.
