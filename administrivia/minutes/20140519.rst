Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Had the first long-duration flight over the weekend. Very successful - the Bushmaster was in AUTO for 1:10 with no major issues.
 * Some issues with ground sterring on takeoff. This is likely due to the increased takeoff weight causing latency in the setting effects.
 * The RC controller had a very low RSSI. Needs further looking into.
 * Matt has bought a 28 dBi grid dish for the 5.8 GHz link.
 * Agreed to buy the Lightwave Lidar unit (40m).
 * Agreed to buy another Odroid (and eMMC card).
 * Next weekend should have the camera and Odroid fitted to the Bushmaster.
