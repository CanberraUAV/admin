Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


workshops
^^^^^^^^^

 * Quadcopter Workshop almost has all the parts. There has been some difficulty in getting the flight electronics from 3DR. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.
 * The Bixler Workshop will start running the second week after the Quadcopter Workshop. This way there is a week gap between the two workshops.


SAR-scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * no action noted


schools-program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * no action noted


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * 3 weeks until D1 is due.
 * Everyone should start looking at our 2012 D1 and comparing it to the 2014 rules for any changes we need to incorporate. Steve will send out and email about this before the weekend.
 * Steve will be meeting with the ADFA and UC teams on Sunday 21 June, during the UAV afternoon session at MHV. This will be primarily to assist them with their D1 entries.


Other business
--------------

 * Darrell Burkey is now the "Official CanberraUAV Photographer". In order to assist media enquiries, Darrell will start taking professional photos of CanberraUAV events and meet-ups. The copyright on these images will be such that media organisations will be able to publish them in their own publications. They will be stored on the CanberraUAV website. Steve will add in an FAQ section that journalists can republish as associated text.
