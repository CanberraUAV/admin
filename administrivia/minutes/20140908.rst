Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Weekend testing was quite successful. The Bushmaster is flying once again. Bottle drop and radio links tests were also sucessful.
 * The Bushmaster did not have enough fuel for a 1 hour flight. Jack will look at fitting a more efficient propellor and larger fuel tank.
 * The laser range finder on the Bushmaster does not work. We will instead fit the one from the Porter.
 * Tests for next weekend: More bottle drops, auto-landings, RC-radio-off test and ground geofence test.
 * Also need to make fittings for the trailer so the Bushmaster can be trailered out to runway during the OBC.
 * Accomodation and transport is mostly sorted.
