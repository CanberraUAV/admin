Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 
 * Weekend testing was cut short by a Bushmaster crash shortly after a bottle drop. The connecting rod on the throttle servo came loose and thus the engine was no longer able to be controlled. A heavy landing in the grass resulted. Moderate damage to the Bushmaster.
 * The Porter is now the only OBC-capable airframe in our possession. Thus no more test flights of the Porter due to crash risks.
 * Accommodation is sorted. Kingaroy Holiday Park will call Stephen on Thursday to confirm. Transport is sorted into 3 convoys.
 * Wednesday night will be packing night.
