Report on in-progress items
---------------------------


OBC2014
^^^^^^^

 * Did two bottle drops over the weekend. Still need to fine tune the mechanism
 * The Bushmaster was involved in a mid-air collisiom with another CMAC member's RC aircraft. Severe damaged ensured.
 * It is unknown if the repairs can be completed before the OBC in 5 weeks.
 * The Pilatus Porter (our backup airframe) will move up to being our primary airframe, subject to permission from the organisers.
 * Emphasis at this stage is to do plenty of bottle drop tests and all-up tests.
 * Some time will need to be taken to do test flights with the Porter to ensure all the equipment on-board works.
 * Decided to buy another (spare) Porter and engine (~$800).
 * Jack will take a closer look at the Bushmaster damage and the repair timeline.
