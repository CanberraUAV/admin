.. _TRL:

Technology Readiness Level
==========================

We use our own version of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to classify the status and progress of our products. This is loosely based on the TRL_classifications_ used by NASA and military agencies. This sometimes helps us keep real about maturity of the technology we use or develop.

.. _TRL_classifications: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level

The levels we use are:

#. Initial Research - what stage is the technology at? Commercially available? Practical to build?

#. Detailed Research - does it seem feasible given CanberraUAV's financial and member resources

#. Ground Prototype - A simple prototype showing that the project's major concepts are sound

#. Small Scale Testing - field testing at a small scale

#. Full Size Testing - scaling up the project to the size we intend to use it at

#. Integration - ensure the project works with the other components (such as radios/ APM) reliably

#. Deployment - It is now able to be used reliably in CanberraUAV's operations
