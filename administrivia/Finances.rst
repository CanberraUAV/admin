This page describes the policy and procedures for spending CanberraUAV funds.


Policy
------

 * Members are able to be reimbursed for any approved CanberraUAV-related expenses.
 * This applies to both physical assets and any administration/compliance costs.
 * This includes *(but is not limited to)*:
    * Parts (mechanical, electrical, IT, etc).
    * Web-based services such as hosting, online journals and databases.
    * Travel expenses, where the additional expense of transporting CanberraUAV equipment (when compared to personal transport) is more than $50.
    * Insurance.
    * General administration and regualtory compliance costs.
 * Receipts must be (electronically) submitted to the Treasurer within 30 days of the purchase.
 * Any members storing physical assets should take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety and condition of the asset is maintained.
 * Any members storing (and with no current plans to use) physical assets are required to transfer the asset to any other team member that requires the asset for an approved CanberraUAV project.
 * When a member gains custody of a physical asset, they are required to advise the Equipment Officer of this. This should be done in a timely fashion.


Procedures
----------

 * The expense must be for a approved CanberraUAV project (list of projects on Github) or for the general administration of the group (ie. insurance, web hosting, permits).
 * Any purchases of less than $50 can be verbally approved by the President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer. This should be preceded by an “FYI” email to the CanberraUAV mailing list in order to double-check that nobody else on the team already has the part(s) in question.
 * Any purchases of $50 or greater must be discussed and approved (by general consensus) at the weekly CanberraUAV Mumble Meetings and published in the resulting minutes. This should include a note of who is organising the purchase.
 * When equipment is no longer required it can be disposed to members of the CanberraUAV team. This must be agreed (by general consensus) at the weekly CanberraUAV Mumble Meetings.


Equipment Officer
-----------------


The Equipment Officer is responsible for procuring and keeping track of CanberraUAV assets.

Specifically:

 * Maintain a register of all valuable (>$50) items purchased by CanberraUAV. 
 * The register should include the item description, cost, website, date purchased, current custodian and current condition (working, broken, lost, etc).
 * Organise the procurement of equipment (purchase, shipping, distribution).
 * Organise the disposal of any unwanted equipment.
 * The equipment list will be stored in 2 locations:
    * On Github (minus details of who is currently holding the item).
    * A private list maintained by the equipment officer and circulated via the private mailing list.
