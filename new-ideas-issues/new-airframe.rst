New Airframe
============

Jack and Chris are been conspiring on a new AirFrame design.

Vital statistics / characteristics:

 * 35-50cc Petrol engine
 * 2.4m span with AR around 6-7:1 (~90 dm^2)
 * light loading (110-150 g/dm^2 @ MTOW)\
 * single engine tractor configuration, high wing
 * STOL characteristics
   - large flaps, bush-wheels
   - thick, high lift wing (e.g. clark-Y 14%)
 * maximise simplicity:
   - rectangular wing planform
   - solid-core, wire-cut foam wing
   - slab-sided box fuselage, a-la "ugly stick"
   - high wing, tractor
   - tail dragger, fixed landing gear
 * rapid, accurate production (extensive use of bespoke jigs)
 * low cost materials: foam, glass, epoxy, pulltruded CF ribons etc.
 * minimum waste; design airframe around generic material sizes

Alternatives considered:
 * A.R.M. PayloadMaster 100 (to big, slow-build)
 * SPAD UltraStick (insufficiently STOL)
 * various built-up kits (slow-build)

Random Ideas for discussion:

Wing Layout, 5 segments (cut from 2400*1200 stock, using 800mm bow):

 * L/R removable panels:
   * outboard segment: 60cm, strip aileron (<20%)
   * inboard segment: 40cm, fowler-style flaps (>30%)

 * center panel:
   * 40cm,
   * fixed/incorporated into airframe, non-removable
   * large fuselage access hatch behind main spar

 * notable fairing, blends center section into fusleage:
   * lower surface -> fuselage walls, 60 degrees off vertical
   * TE strake, accomodating/streamlining lower surface fairing
   * windows in fairing for roll-stabilised twin NADIR camera setup
