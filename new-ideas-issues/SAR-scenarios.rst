SAR Scenario Project
====================

The SAR scenarios raised at the :ref:'20130314_Belconnen_SES_presentation_' seem worthy of further development. Ultimately, it would be great if we had documented them sufficiently well that SAR professionals are motivated to review them and contribute usefull feedback.

Proposal:

 * create a GitHub project that is a collection of scenarios.
 * for each scenario:

   * elaborate the description
   * add relevant link, etc.
   * seek and respond to feedback from SAR community.

 * capture usefull meta data

   * create some sort of mechanism for evaluating the usefulness of each scenario. Possibly some sort of voting system / straw poll.
   * map system capabilities to scenarios. Some sort of feature matrix binding.
   * use this to evaluate the value of technical development options

 * capture new scenarios from the SAR community
 * the idea is that the scenarios repository/project would eventually become

   * table top exercises
   * joint simulated field exercises
   * operations manual
