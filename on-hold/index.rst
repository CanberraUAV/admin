.. _on-hold:

Work currently on hold
======================

Not "dead projects" (see :ref:`lessons`), simply ones where nobody has undertaken to do any work **this week** (at the most recent :ref:`mumble-session`).

   :maxdepth: 1 
   :glob:

If someone undertakes to work on one of these at a :ref:`mumble-session`, it becomes :ref:`wip`.
