Description: A roll/pitch stabilised platform for cameras on the UAV. Should have a cover to protect the camera during takeoff and landing

Developers: Chris, Matt

We have a roll stabilized camera in our muggin UAV. During search phase pitch doesn't vary much, but the roll stabilisation is needed. If we are to search more undulating terrain, we would probably require pitch stabilisation too.

The current runway-based airframe has the camera lens protruding from the fuselage belly. It is kept clear of the ground on takeoff and landing by the undercarriage. If we are to move to belly-landing, bungee or catapult launched airframes (so we don't need a runway), then we will need another way to protect the camera on landing.

One concept we should explore is a retracting camera turret. The other option is a retractable landing shield. This model demonstrates both:
