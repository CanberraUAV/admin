D-GPS for increased positioning accuracy 
========================================

Stage: 4

Description: A cheap Differential GPS (D-GPS) system for increased positioning accuracy

Developers: Tridge, Chris

Status - Initial results for carrier phase corrections. While it's working, the current software provides SBAS-like performance in areas without SBAS coverage (such as Australia).

Software for generating RTCM2 messages using uBlox RAW data (generated by e.g. LEA6P module).

Works quite well for extended periods, with occasional very poor performance (reasons currently not understood).

Current scope does not include RTK solution.
