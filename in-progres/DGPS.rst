D-GPS for increased positioning accuracy 
========================================

:ref:`TRL`: 3 

Description: A cheap Differential GPS (D-GPS) system for increased positioning accuracy

Developers: Tridge, Chris

Status - Demonstrated carrier phase corrections by sending RTCM2 messages from a base station to roving GPS.

When it is functioning correctly, the current software provides SBAS-like performance in areas without SBAS coverage (such as Australia).

Software for generating RTCM2 messages using uBlox RAW data (generated by e.g. LEA6P module).

It works quite well for extended periods (significantly improved positional accuracy), there are occasional episodes of very poor performance (up to 60m additional error). The reason's for the occasional poor performance are currently not understood, possibly a simple bug.

Current scope does not include RTK solution, although this work is considered a stepping stone to an RTK solution.

The current solution probably has significant room for optimisation, however squashing the occasional poor performance bug is a higher priority, because it makes the prototype unflyable in it's current form.

Development facilities
-----------------------

Test hardware for RTCM server is mounted sub-optimally on Tridge's roof. The receivers are subject to quite bad multipath interference, the weatherproofing is possibly inadequate, and line of sight to satellites is partially blocked by structures and foliage. While the software will be required to work in real world (suboptimal) installations, for the purpose of development/testing a good reception scenario is also required.

Work is underway to construct a secure roof mounted enclosure with more favorable reception characteristics. It will also feature a powered USB hub for simplified cable management and increased flexibility with regard to supported configurations.
