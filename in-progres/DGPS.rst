D-GPS for increased positioning accuracy 
========================================

:ref:`TRL`: 3 

Description: A cheap Differential GPS (D-GPS) system for increased positioning accuracy

Developers: Tridge, Chris

Status - Demonstated carrier phase corrections by sending RTCM2 messages from a base station to roving GPS.

When it is functioning correctly, the current software provides SBAS-like performance in areas without SBAS coverage (such as Australia).

Software for generating RTCM2 messages using uBlox RAW data (generated by e.g. LEA6P module).

It works quite well for extended periods (significantly improved positional accuracy), there are occasional episodes of very poor performance (up to 60m aditional error). The resaon's for the occasional poor performance are currently not understood, possibly a simple bug.

Current scope does not include RTK solution, althought this work is considered a stepping stone to an RTK solution.

The current solution probably has significant room for optimisation, however squashing the occasional poor performance bug is a higher priority, because it makes the prototype unflyable in it's current form.
