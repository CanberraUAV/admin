D-GPS for increased positioning accuracy 
========================================

:ref:`TRL`: 4

Description: A cheap Differential GPS (D-GPS) system for increased positioning accuracy

Developers: Tridge, Chris

Status - Initial results for carrier phase corrections. While it's working, the current software provides SBAS-like performance in areas without SBAS coverage (such as Australia).

Software for generating RTCM2 messages using uBlox RAW data (generated by e.g. LEA6P module).

Works quite well for extended periods, with occasional very poor performance (reasons currently not understood).

Current scope does not include RTK solution.

Development facilities
-----------------------

Test hardware for RTCM server is mounted suboptimally on tridge's roof. The receivers are subject to quite bad multipath interference, the weatherproofing is possibly inadequate,  and line of sight to satelites is partially blocked by structures and foliage. While the software will be required to work in real world (suboptimal) installations, for the purpose of development/testing a good reception scenario is also required.

Work is underway to construct a secure roof mounted enclosure with more favorable reception characteristics. It will also feature a powered USB hub for simplified cable management and increased flexibility with regard to supported configurations.
