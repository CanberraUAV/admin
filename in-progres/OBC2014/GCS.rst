Ground Control Station
======================

This is a plan for how the Ground Control Station (GCS) will be set up and run.

Basic Setup
-----------

The GCS will consist of:

 * Table with 3 laptops to monitor and control UAV
 * Van to provide power and shade
 * Automatic antenna tracker (AAT)
 * Backup (manual) antenna tracker (BAT)

Table
-----

The table will sit under the rear door on the van (providing shade), providing space for 3 laptops. There will be 3 chairs for the ground station operators.

Power and networking will be provided by rear section of the van, close to the table.


Van
---

The van will contain a set of large SLA batteries and an interver to provide 240V to 3x laptops.

There will also be XT60 connectors for direct DC connections to radio equipment. UBECs will be used to step down the voltage where needed.

The back of the van will contain a mounted 42" LCD TV, facing the operators at the table. The TV will connect to the master ground control laptop via VGA or HDMI.


Automatic Antenna Tracker
-------------------------
The AAT will be mounted to the side of the van and anchored by the right rear wheel, extending vertically upwards ~4m. It will have both the 900MHz and 5.8 GHz antennas on it. Power will be provided by the van.


Backup (Manual) Antenna Tracker
-------------------------------

In case the AAT fails, the BAT (same as the one used in the 2012 OBC) will be used. It will be set up on a tripod near the van. It will contain the 5.8 GHz antenna only, as the 900 MHz antenna has a wide enough beamwidth to not be greatly affected by non-pointing.

Thus, if the AAT fails the 5.8GHz radio LAN cable will be quikcly swapped over from the AAT to the BAT.


Other
-----

A label printer will be connected to one of the secondary GCS laptops for the purpose of quickly and accurately printing the position of Joe.

Communications between the GCS and pilot will be via CB radios with earpieces.

A clearly identified box will contain all spare GCS cables.
