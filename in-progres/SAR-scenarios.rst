SAR Scenario Project
====================

This is a proposal to undertake a CanberraUAV project called something like "SAR Scenarios".

The theories behind this project proposal are:

 * documented user-stories might be a good way to engage SAR community
 * iterating over documented user-stories might be a development path to joint exercises with the SAR community (i.e. user stories evolve into workshops, desktop exercises, experimental field exercises, etc)
 * engagement with the SAR community over user-stories might drive "real world" qualities into our next OBC entry.

Minimum viable product:

 * elaborate the SAR scenarios raised at the :ref:`20130314_Belconnen_SES_presentation`.
 * discover some new SAR scenarios
 * seek and respond to feedback from the SAR communities.

We know we have been successful if:

 * the SAR community are motivated to contribute content to the user-stories
 * the SAR scenarios prove useful in helping us prioritise technology development efforts


Plan
----

From stories, through exercises, to a real rescue.

Phase 1 - requirements discovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * list and describe various scenarios
 * seek SAR community review/feedback
 * update scenarios, summarise feedback, iterate...
 * ...as long as we keep getting valuable feedback
 * ...halt this phase when we have a well-validated (by SAR community) short list of scenarios that are compatible with CanberraUAV technical development goals (OBC 2014).

**Objectives**:

 * discover new requirements / scenarios
 * obtain more elaborate information about known scenarios
 * validate requirements by finding people in the SAR community that can verify the requirements are real
 * develop a vehicle to focus / nurture relationship with the SAR community

**Iteration 1**: 

 * new repository github.com/CanberraUAV/SAR-scenarios.git
 * initialise content
 * evaluate feedback/engagement mechanisms

Questions:

 * apart from the user-story itself, what meta data do we need to capture?
 * how to evaluate the usefulness of each scenario? voting system / straw poll?
 * how to relate user-stories to technology features? how to get these requirements driving development?


Phase 2 - requirements elaboration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with a small number of stories that are well matched to CanberraUAV development goals, seek more detailed information about them. Identify variations/alternatives, operational/functional requirements, operational risks, etc.

Build on relationships with SAR community and try to engage them with table top exercises, workshops, etc. Create confidence by demonstrating development progress against SAR community requirements.

Phase 3 - experimental joint exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Undertake joint exercises, possibly cumulating in a SAR community entry into OBC2014.

Phase 4 - transitional capability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Leverage progress to deliver operational UAV capability to the SAR community.
