MuOptics are running an indiegogo campeign to fund production of a low cost, low resolution thermal camera for thermal imageing purposes. It's approximately 10% the cost of the equivelent FLIR camera. It may be suitable for noctournal searching!

Action required: purchase the $150 Not So Early Adopters Special ($150), estimated delivery in May 2013.

When the camera arrives, we will evaluate it's capability and suitability for nocturnal searching.
