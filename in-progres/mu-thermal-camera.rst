Mu Thermal camera

MuOptics are running an indiegogo campaign to fund production of a low cost, low resolution thermal camera for thermal imaging purposes. It's approximately 10% the cost of the equivalent FLIR camera. It may be suitable for nocturnal searching!

Steve has purchased the $150 Not So Early Adopters Special ($150), estimated delivery in May 2013.

When the camera arrives, we will evaluate it's capability and suitability for nocturnal searching.

The stage of testing the camera will be:

#. Ability to see a human body heat signature
#. As above, on a UAV at 90m altitude
#. All of the above, whilst flying at ~100km/h

If the camera satisfies the above tests, it stands a high chance of being useful for our Search and Rescue missions.
