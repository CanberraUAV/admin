SES Presentation
================

We have an opportunity to present to the Belconnen SES.

Current Capability
------------------

> what you're capable of doing at the moment?

We essentially have two capabilities; operational capability to compete in (and win) the OBC competition, and development capability to push the boundaries of what's currently possible with open-source UAV technology. We use the OBC search and rescue competition to focus our development efforts.

We have several small scale technology demonstrators showing the major features of our search and rescue capability:

 * Cameras
 * Automatic person recognition
 * Automatic waypoint generation, given a search area
 * Ground station

Currently we can search a 2x4km area in less than 1 hour (assuming a nearby sealed road/runway to use) using our main UAV.

Current Activity
----------------

> what you're working on/think might be possible?

We are currently working on:

 * Ability to takeoff from unprepared tracks or surfaces (using a catapult or similar)
 * More automation of flight phases
 * Longer range and larger search areas
 * Incremental upgrades to the camera and image processing system will allow us to cover a given search area in less time
 * Better terrain avoidance
 * Sense and avoid of manned aircraft
 * More user-friendly ground station software
 * Better positioning accuracy for the UAV
 * Reducing and simplifying setup time
 * Increasing overall reliability of systems (especially the autopilot and fail-safe devices)

> What's possible?

One day, a future version of the technology we are making now will save a life in the ACT. It's not a matter of *if*, it's a matter of **when**.

There is much work to do before that can happen though. In 18 months we will be fielding at least one team in the next OBC SAR competition. Our main development goal is to demonstrate capability much closer real world SAR requirements.

SAR Ignorance
-------------

> what you guys want to know from us?

We don't know what we don't know. How far are we from being able to work with the SES?

 * table-top exercises?
 * field exercises?
 * ... possibility of contributing to an actual search?

Characteristics of a typical SAR operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * What is the average search area size?
 * How fast can it be searched on foot?

System requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * What level of ease-of-use of the software is needed?
 * Would you be comfortable operating the UAV in manual mode if the autopilot fails?
 * Do you require the ability for the UAV to drop a small payload to the stranded person (water, radio?)
 * What sort of setup time is required (is currently 4 or so hours, using 4 people)
 * Does the entire UAV/Ground station need to be self-contained. Like a plug and play system?

Resource availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * What infrastructure (if any) could you furnish us with at the “base command” of a SAR or training exercise? (power, radios, Internet, fuel, takeoff/landing space)
 * If the UAV does crash, could you assist with recovery?
