MHV Quadcopter project 
======================

Developers: Steve

Status: In progress

Description: Run a workshop for the MakeHackVoid (MHV) community, showing them how to build and fly APM-based quadcopters.

The quadcopter is designed to be:

* (Relatively) Cheap
* Commonly available spare parts
* Open source or hackable hardware/software where available
* Easy for beginners to build
* Strong/tough enough to withstand beginner pilots
* Able to carry a 200g payload (such as a small camera)

The workshop itself is designed to be:

* Accessible to beginners
* Full documentation of the build process
* Able to be completed in 3 to 4 evenings (not including flight time)
* Educational as to how quadcopter work and how to safely use them
