2016 UAV Challenge
==========================

The 2016 UAV Challenge (Medical Express) was the 3rd time CanberraUAV had entered the competition.

We came 1st place, successfully landing 40.6m from Outback Joe and returning safely to the base. Unfortunately the comms relay UAV crashed partway through the mission.

A total of 10 teams made it to Dalby, with 3 teams finding Joe and only CanberraUAV performing a successful landing next to Joe.
