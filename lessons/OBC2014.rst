The 2014 UAV Outback Challenge (OBC) was the 2nd time CanberraUAV had entered the competition.

We came 1st place, successfully dropping a bottle of water to within 2.6m of Joe.

A total of 16 teams made it to Kingaroy, 4 teams being able to drop a water bottle within 100m of Joe (another team dropped the bottle more than 100m from Joe).
