This will help to avoid any basic errors/crashes.

Before leaving home:
* Radio telemetry link working
* RC controls working
* Battery fully charged
* No physical damage to quadcopter

At the field:
* Ensure flight is being logged to a nearby laptop
* Turn on text-to-speech mode to get audio feedback of mode changes
* Be aware of weather conditions. Particularly wind
* Bring the quadcopter down if people are in the vicinity
* If you think something is going wrong, bring the quadcopter down immediately
* Check for damage after a heavy landing
* Don't forget to DISARM the quadcopter immediately after landing
