MHV Quadcopter Workshop 2.0 (July 2013)
=======================================

Developer: Stephen. With help from Tridge

The purpose of this workshop was to guide a group of 9 attendees through the process of building, calibrating and flying APM-based quadcopters.

It should be:

* Cheap, but with a focus on strength
* Commonly available spare parts
* Open source or hackable hardware/software where available
* Easy for beginners to build - minimal soldering
* Strong/tough enough to withstand beginner pilots
* Able to carry a 200g payload (such as a small camera)

The workshop itself is designed to be:

* Accessible to beginners
* Full documentation of the build process
* Able to be completed in 3 to 4 evenings (not including flight time)
* Educational as to how quadcopters work and how to safely use them
